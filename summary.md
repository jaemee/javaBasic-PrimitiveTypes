# Question
1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2. Why the test failed at first?
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

## BooleanOperatorsTest

#should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
1. To learn how logical operations works in java with just looking at the condition. Document: https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/logical-operators-in-java/
2. Wrong expected result for single logical operators
3. Learned from re-reading the materials on how single logical operators ( |, &) works when it will be true/ false
4. None.


#should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
1. Learning the combination of checking or using bitwise together with boolean operators. Document: https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/bit-manipulation-java-bitwise-bit-shift-operations/
2. Looking at the original codes it will fail because as per looking with the hexadecimal values it's won't return to 0, no matter what.
3. I corrected the test's expected result directly as an integer value since I can straightly get the value from the 2 hexadecimal converted to binary and using the logical operators
4. None.

#should_do_bitwise_or_boolean_operation
1. Same as above should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
2. Same as above should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
3. Same as above should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
4. Same as above should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation

#should_do_bitwise_not_operation
1. To learn the NOT operation with bitwise. Document: https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/bit-manipulation-java-bitwise-bit-shift-operations/
2. Same as above should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation. 
3. I put the binary value to correct the test because the decimal value of my answer is too big for an int type
4. After I add my answer and run the test and succeed I got curious what the value of the actual 
really is, why too big integer so I re run the test. I found out that the value of the Actual is negative,
I was wondering why my answer with positive big value equals to negative value using binary?
I also read that with NOT operation the value will be flipped, so it will be negative, but I don't get
how I will have negative when I was doing the computation and got a positive answer instead. If there are other 
documents I can reference please share.




##CharTypeTest

#should_describe_escaped_chars
1. To learn and describe how to use escaped characters in java. Document: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html
2. After coding, my first run failed because I'm using binary and got the wrong binary for backspace to get char
3. During coding I realize that the modification should be using the escaped string directly set to the final variable 
and not the binary value
4. None. 


##IntegerTypeTest

#should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
1. To learn the different primitive types and to use primitive type constants. Documents: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html
2. Not fail at first because I put changes before running test (Same as above answer, I always modify first before running tests)
3. Because as per rule apply, we need to take use of constant primitive type and Actual needs MAX/ MIN_VALUE
4. None.

#should_get_range_of_primitive_short_type
1. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
2. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
3. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
4. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type

#should_get_range_of_primitive_long_type
1. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
2. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
3. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
4. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type

#should_get_range_of_primitive_byte_type
1. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
2. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
3. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
4. Same as above should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type

#should_overflow_silently
1. To learn overflowing of int in java. Document: https://dzone.com/articles/overflow-and-underflow-data
2. No idea what will happen to an int value if it surpasses it's MAX_VALUE
3. Change the code with Integer.MIN_VALUE, since as per reading document any 32-bit java that surpasses 32 bit will get rounded, so adding 1 to Max will return the 
lowest value of Integer
4. None

#should_underflow_silently
1. To learn under flowing of int in java. Document: https://dzone.com/articles/overflow-and-underflow-data
2. Default 0 won't return success
3. Same as above but reverse. When MIN_VALUE is subtracted by 1, then value will rounded to tha MAX_VALUE of a 32-bit
4. None.

#should_take_care_of_number_type_when_doing_calculation
1. To learn how to handle number type to double when using calculations.
2. Default 0 won't return success
3. I changed the result to a whole number to test the number type handling
4. None.

#should_truncate_number_when_casting
1. To learn the real behaviour when casting primitive values in java
2. Default 0 won't return success
3. Changed the result to 16bit value of the given hexadecimal integer as per the Actual is a short type
4. None.

#should_increment
1. To learn increment behaviour
2. Same as above
3. Increment after the value will only increment the original value of the variable and not the new var where the vaule incremented is set
4. None.

#should_increment_2
1. Same as above should_increment
2. Same as above
3. Increment before the value while assigning to a new variable increments both the value of the original and the new variable
4. None.

#should_throw_exception_when_overflow
1. To learn how to catch an overflow / any exception with try and catch
2. Confused which exception to be thrown, the one inside the checking or the one in the catch clause
3. Added checking for overflow, inside if I put the default Throw Exception since the original exception to be return will be the one on the catch clause 
so I put the Arithmetic Exception inside the catch clause
4. None.

#just_prevent_lazy_implementation
1. To learn if the codes in the method add is dynamic and can be used without an exception and if it will return the correct value
2. No errors occurred, since already fixed in above test
3. No change. Just run the test (method already created and can handle the test from above test : should_throw_exception_when_overflow)
4. None.


##FloatingTypeTest

#should_judge_special_double_cases
1. To use the Double class default functions for math computation errors. (Cannot divide by 0/ Not a Number errors)
2. No errors occurred.
3. Added try and catch so no need to remove the default throw exception in Method and to handle the Infinite/NaN test
4. None.

#should_not_get_rounded_result_if_convert_floating_number_to_integer
1. To know casting behaviour for primitive types
2. No errors. Default expected result will not return success test just by looking at the code.
3. Directly set the number because setting is for expected result and int casting cast float to it's equivalent whole number without rounding off\
so basically just removing the decimal places
4. None

#should_not_round_number_when_convert_to_integer
1. Same as above. Same method logic
2. Same as above. Same method logic
3. Same as above. Same method logic
4. None

#should_round_number
1. To learn how to use Math functions for the correct casting of numbers mathematically
2. No errors. Default expected result will not return success test just by looking at the code.
3. Changes result using Math built in methods to round off the given number to it's correct value when round off since type casting will not result to a rounded value
4. None
