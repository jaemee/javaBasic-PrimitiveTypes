# Question
1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2. Why the test failed at first?
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

## BooleanOperatorsTest

#should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
1. To learn how logical operations works in java with just looking at the condition. Document: https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/logical-operators-in-java/
2. Wrong expected result for single logical operators
3. Learned from re-reading the materials on how single logical operators ( |, &) works when it will be true/ false
4. None.


#should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
1. Learning the combination of checking or using bitwise together with boolean operators. Document: https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/bit-manipulation-java-bitwise-bit-shift-operations/
2. Looking at the original codes it will fail because as per looking with the hexadecimal values it's won't return to 0, no matter what.
3. I corrected the test's expected result directly as an integer value since I can straightly get the value from the 2 hexadecimal converted to binary and using the logical operators
4. None.
